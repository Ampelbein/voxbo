You can now use a cluster size criterion with a permutation test.
That is, you can set a cluster size criterion, and identify a
threshold at which the probability of observing clusters of that sizer
or greater is controlled.  If you have already run permutation tests
and you still have the data around, you can do this without re-running
the whole permutation.  See the help for vbperminfo for more
information.

Numerous changes to the regression code should make it all more robust
and slightly faster, and lay the groundwork for using your image data
as an independent measure (as in lesion analysis).

Linear detrending is now an option in your GLM design (via glm or
vbmakeglm).  Like mean scaling, the detrending is done at the time of
regression.

Numerous improvements to file format support, including NIfTI-1
support, slightly improved DICOM support, and the executables
analyzeinfo and dicominfo.

vbconv is a new executable that converts between arbitrary file
formats.  It guesses the right format on the basis of extensions, so
it's easier to use than vb2tes, vb2img, etc.  All of these file format
conversion programs now support the -n flag to remove NaNs and Infs,
and the -f flag to convert to floating point.

vbmaskmunge, an executable for thresholding, quantizing, and otherwise
manipulating cubes, has more features.  Some of these are useful for
non-mask manipulation.

IDL-dependence in VoxBo has been reduced to two components: the audit
job in the GLM sequence, and the voxel surfer.  The audit job is
optional, we're hoping to have a much more functional and helpful
audit job written in c soon.  You can do some voxel surfing in vbview,
and we will be releasing periodic updates to make it much more
functional over the next few months.

vbview: numerous changes.  F5-F9 can now be used to hide/show various
panels.  mask copy/paste lets you copy/paste slices.  GLM viewing is
much more capable than previously.

contrasts files: A GLM folder can now have a "contrasts" file -- if
the other files in the directory are called "myglm.xxx," the contrasts
file is called "myglm.contrasts".  You can list all your contrasts of
interest here, give them simple names, and thereafter just use the
names instead of ugly strings of numbers.  The format is:
  <name> <scale> <type> <values...>
e.g., 
  my_t_contrast t vec 0 0 1 1 -1 -1 0 0
If the number of weights isn't the same as the number of covariates of
interest, the contrast will be ignored silently.

Most of the file format converters, including vbconv, vb2tes, vb2cub,
vb2img, and vb2imgs, now take the -f option to convert to floating
point (single-precision) and the -n option to remove NaNs and Infs
(replace with 0's).  Conversion to floating point may be useful to
avoid quantization when the volumes are subsequently resliced (e.g.,
in motion correction or normalization).  Removing NaNs may be useful
because some software has difficulty dealing with non-finite values.
Be careful when using -n on files where 0 is a legitimate and
meaningful value.

vbhdr will now replace {DATE} with the current date and {HOST} with
the short version of the name of the host it's running on.  This is
probably most useful in scripts.  Suggestions for other such tags are
welcomed, and will be implemented quickly.

--> updated spm realign and norm jobtypes and sample scripts, more robust
--> binaries for OSX panther now available for most command line utils
--> fixes to analyze format to improve compatibility with other programs
--> numerous minor bug fixes
--> -f and -n options in vb2xxx
--> glm file in glm dir is no longer just a copy of your original,
    it's exactly the parameters used to run your analysis

--> fsl script docs
--> gds, and gdw generating gds scripts
--> fdr with f-tests working now!
--> vbpermmat generates perm matrices and does nothing else
--> vbts will count the unique voxels in your 4D volume
--> new vbdumpstats program does useful stuff!
--> vbcmp replaces cmp3d, compares 3d and 4d volumes (not with each other)
--> new executable: vbse creates smoothness estimates
--> new exec vbvec2hdr turns vectors into headers
--> vbbatch can now take an IND tag
--> vbmakeglm now understands "pieces"
--> vbmaskinfo (or vbmaskcompare)
--> vbconv sort of replaces vb2tes vb2cub etc.
--> dicom image shift problem fixed
--> vbinterpolate


SCHEDULER
--> errors mid-stream cause the whole thing to stop
--> more robust catching of matlab license failures
--> server files are used for local config
--> loglevel is totally gone, all logs are kept with the sequence
--> pri zero means don't run automatically, 5 is a new high priority
--> server file (root/etc/servers/foo) is accessed only from the
    server end, and has a name that matches either all or part of the
    hostname (which may be set via serveralias).  that file in turn
    has the shortname by which the server is known as well as the
    "hostname" which is how the scheduler is to contact it.
