VoxBo v1.5
Release Notes
August 29, 2003

Thank you for taking the time to read about VoxBo release 1.5!

As with release 1.4, release 1.5 includes a lot of bug fixes and
enhancements, but it is not a complete release.  If you just want to
take advantage of some of VoxBo's stand-alone tools (even if you're
not already using VoxBo), then 1.4 is probably all you need.  If you
want a complete installation with the job scheduler, you'll have to
install it over 1.3b7 (or wait for the next release).

Highlights of the new code are listed here.  As always, I encourage
you to read this carefully, as there is some new functionality that
may be helpful.

--> there have been some substantial improvements to vbview, including
    a new "tri-view" mode (axial, coronal, and sagittal views
    simultaneously), an awkward but useful "info" pane, rendering
    performance improvements, and various other enhancements and
    fixes.  There is now a vbview doc page at
    www.voxbo.org/docs/vbview.html that documents how things work at
    the moment.

--> vbmakeglm should now give you a warning if the meannorm flag was
    unspecified, or if you're mean normalizing your data in suspicious
    circumstances.

--> vbmakeglm should now write the appropriate headers to the .exofilt
    and .intrincor files

--> vbrename and the dicom conversion tools should now handle a wider
    variety of kinds of dicom data more reliably, including
    big-endian.

--> setorigin -m should be more reliable with various kinds of data.

--> The new script newprep.sh should produce a good anatomy directory
    from just an anatomical volume and a sample epi

--> vb2tes can now take either single 3D files (of any supported
    format) or directories full of 3D files and convert them to 4D
    time series.

--> A new executable, vbfit, will take care of your 1/f parameter
    estimation.  It's available as a stand-alone tool, and also within
    the gdw and glm interfaces.

--> The command line glm and gdw interfaces should both now provide
    cutoff frequencies for your covariates.

--> the new vbsmooth executable will gaussian smooth your data

--> the new vbregion executable will provide summary stats on regions
    in a stat cube

--> Although it's not completely new, note that the vbhdr executable
    is available for some automatic header munging.

--> A dumb bug that would cause normalizing 4D data to fail has been
    fixed.

--> There is a new executable, vbsim, that produces simulated data.
    its functionality is fairly limited right now, but it was useful
    to me so it might be useful to you.

----------------------------------------------------

--> This release includes both updated command line programs (source
    and binaries) and updated IDL code.  Some of the binaries are
    described briefly below, and many of them are useful even if
    you're not using the rest of VoxBo.  If there's something you'd
    like to try, you should be able to get some help by typing its
    name at the command line.  Note that you can get a list of all the
    VoxBo tools via the web site (www.voxbo.org/tools.html).

--> If you have an existing running VoxBo installation, as always we
    recommend making a copy before doing anything too crazy.  It's as
    simple as "cp -rp VoxBo OldVoxBo."  Then you can install the
    new release over your existing installation.

--> To install everything in default locations inside
    /usr/local/VoxBo, go into the distribution directory ("voxbo-1.4")
    and type "make install".  If you want to set some of the target
    directories manually, you can add any of the following to the
    command line:

    BINDIR=/usr/local/bin   [specifies a location for the executables]
    PRODIR=/usr/local/pros  [location for the IDL stuff]
    FFDIR=/usr/local/lib    [location for the file format plug-ins]

    So if you just want to use one or two of the binaries, and you
    don't have a special VoxBo directory, you might do:

    make install BINDIR=/usr/local/bin PRODIR=/tmp FFDIR=/usr/local/lib
    
    If for some reason you want to be selective about which binaries
    you install, specify a temporary directory and then manually copy
    whatever you want.  None of the binaries in this update need
    special permissions.  Note that the file format plug-ins need to
    be in certain predefined locations, namely: /lib, /usr/lib,
    /usr/local/lib, or /usr/local/VoxBo/etc/fileformats.






--> The IDL code requires the binary I/O plug-in "idlvbio.so," which
    is built along with the other c code.  The included compiled
    version should work with IDL 5.6, but not other versions.  If you
    need to compile it on your own, see the notes in the file
    BUILD-1.4.





--> If you have to build the binaries on your own, see the file
    BUILD-1.4, which has some more detailed notes on building the
    code.

--> For the moment, we're doing away with the release numbering scheme
    that resulted in nonsense like 1.3b3p6.  So this patch is 1.4, the
    next patch or full release will be 1.5, etc.

--> This release includes code from myself, Geoff Aguirre, Kosh
    Banerjee, and Dongbo Hu.

Thank you for your time.
