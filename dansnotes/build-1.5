VoxBo v1.4
Build Notes
June 25, 2003

Here are some notes on how to build VoxBo release 1.4, in case you'd
like to build your own version.  These notes describe how the release
was built.  If you follow them exactly, you should get exactly what's
already in the release.

Our build box is a RedHat 7.2 machine (actually installed under
vmware), installed as a "workstation" with development tools selected,
and no patches.  We installed the following additional components,
available from the VoxBo web site:

gcc 3.3
gsl 1.3
octave 2.1.49
qt 3.0.8

Note that if you only need to build the IDL plug-in (called dlm or
IDLI), you can skip some of these steps as noted below.

1. build and install gcc

   we used the --disable-shared option, you may not have to if all
   your machines have the same version of the c++ libs

2. build and install the gsl libs

   again, we used --disable-shared, not necessary if you have gsl libs
   on all your machines

3. build and install qt

   use the -thread option to build libqt-mt, otherwise you'll have to
   play with the makefiles some.  we also used the -static option,
   again for portability.  we put everything in /usr/local/qt, and
   wiped out the existing copy of moc in /usr/bin, just to make sure.

4. build and install octave

   this is a pain still.  our octave build crashed partway through, so
   we did a "make install" in liboctave, libcruft, and then copied and
   manually reorganized header files from within the build directory
   to /usr/local/include/octave.

4. create the voxbo directory structure in /usr/local/VoxBo,
   especially the bin, etc, and etc/fileformats directories.

5. in the voxbo src directory, do:
   ./configure
   make
   make install

   Note that if you only need the IDLI plug-in, you can cd to the
   "dlm" directory after running the configure script, and you'll just
   build and install dlm.  However, this may only work if you're using
   similar build tools to the above.  Otherwise the IDL plug-in you
   build and the fileformat plug-ins may not be compatible.  If you'd
   like us to build a version for your copy of IDL, just let us know.

6. enjoy!

If you have any trouble, feel free to post to the voxbo-general
mailing list.
