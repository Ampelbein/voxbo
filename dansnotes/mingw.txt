glob is a serious issue
regex is just in koshutils, kill
probably need to conditionalize tcgetattr for windows
how do we set a socket as nonblocking under mingw?  can probably put
  this off, utils will still work



MESSAGE FROM MJUMBE FOLLOWS



ok, below should be the complete list of what needed changing for
libvoxbo to compile.  all of the qt stuff that is in the 1.8.4 release
uses qt3, if i am not mistaken.  should i try to see what of that
stuff will run on windows, or are you primarily concerned with qt4
applications?

------------------------------

Make sure /cygdrive/c/MinGW/bin comes before /usr/bin and
/usr/local/bin in the $PATH environment variable (if compiling with
cygwin).

vbutil √
------
- no include regex.h
- no include termios.h
- no include sys/ioctl.h
- no include glob.h
- no "glob_transfer"

gsl √
---
- install gsl with /cygdrive/c/MinGW prefix
- (note: gsl appears to have a problem compiling with MinGW, but
people seem to be using the gsl for windows.)

vbio √
----
- no include glob.h
- no "ContainsMatchingFiles"

filecheck √
---------
- no "getOwnerUserID"
- no "getOwnerGroupID"
- no "getLinkCount"
- "init" function uses "realpath" (posix), makes the structure
un-initable on windows. :(   trying without "realpath".
- stupid block comments everywhere make it impossible to comment out
large portions of code at once!
- "isLink" function uses "lstat" and S_ISLINK.  just going to make
"isLink" return false.
- "isSocket" uses S_ISSOCK.  return false.
- "isGroupReadable" uses S_IRGRP.  return false.
- "isOtherReadable" uses S_IROTH.  return false.
