<h2>VoxBo Roadmap, February 2004</h2>

<p>
Welcome to the VoxBo Roadmap, February 2004 Edition.  The purpose of
this document is twofold: to let VoxBo users know what's in the works
and to make sure VoxBo developers are all on the same page.  I'd be
grateful for any feedback (by email or via discussion on
voxbo-general), but bear in mind that this not an exhaustive list of
our plans, and many feature requests and outstanding issues are not
listed here.  This is just an overview of the big picture stuff in the
short- and medium term future of VoxBo, as I see it at the moment.
</p>

<h3>Recent and Imminent New Stuff</h3>

<p>
(These are things we have some concrete reason to be happy about.)
</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
QT-based GLM designer - Dongbo Hu's first major contribution to VoxBo
has been available since 1.4, and as of 1.6 should have all the
functionality of the old IDL-based program.  We're now ready to turn
our attention to new functionality and feature requests.

<li>
IDL-free GLM - Kosh Banerjee has ported a bunch of IDL-based GLM
components to c, eliminating a big drain on IDL licenses.  For labs on
a budget, this might be a good time to think about how many of those
IDL licenses you really want to renew.

<li>
vbview - Most VoxBo users are by now familiar with vbview, the
replacement for voxsurf and maybe someday an alternative to the voxel
surfer.  vbview is the best way to edit multiple masks simultaneously
in VoxBo right now, and has been getting new features at a good rate,
including multiple views, statistical overlays, etc.

<li>
Unified, modular I/O - Kosh's IDLI code and my modular file format
plug-ins together provide some powerful new tools for handling
different file formats in VoxBo.  If there's a format you'd like to
see supported, please let us know.

<li>
Permutation Testing - Geoff's tools for permutation testing put VoxBo
at (or at least near) the forefront of fMRI analysis packages for
doing permutation-based analyses.  We consider the availability of
permutation testing a major (and positive) shift in the direction of
statistical analyses supported by VoxBo.  If you aren't using
permutation-based methods to threshold your maps, you may not be
getting the most out of your data.

<li>
Quality Assurance - vbqa is a new(ish) program that goes through your
data, finds things to warn you about (or things that you might want to
check), and puts them all on one big web page.  Although we can
imagine lots of additional functionality that might be useful, the
current incarnation is good enough to save you some grief.  If you're
not using it, give it a shot.

<li>
The mailing lists have been generally active and we hope helpful.

<li>
OS compatibility - VoxBo hasn't compiled under Solaris for quite a
while now, but we hope that will change by this summer.  OSX
compatibility is also on the horizon (we've had a few promising builds
already), which we expect will really help some labs take advantage of
idle hardware.  We're also hoping to have a more flexible scheduling
system that's a little smarter about figuring out when your machine is
available for jobs.

<li>
A VoxBo article, finally - it makes us happy when people cite the web
page, but it will make us even happier when people cite the article.
If all goes well, it will be in a Medline-indexed journal sometime
this year.

<li>
We continue to close in on some dramatically improved tools for
structural methods.  Expect an announcement soon!

<li>
VoxBo has a home - the newly formed <a
href="http://cfn.upenn.edu/">Center for Functional Neuroimaging</a> at
Penn is the home of VoxBo development.

<li>
The VoxBo manual is now available in DocBook format.  This means that
in the future it will be easy for us to produce synchronized HTML,
pdf, and rtf (Word) versions of the manual.  The actual content of the
manual is unfortunately still pretty out of date, but we're finally in
a good position to start working on it again.  Of course,
contributions are always welcome.

<li>
The automation system we released last year, centered around the
vbmakeprep script processor, turned out to be too much of a pain for
most folks to use.  Luckily Tom King has come aboard Team VoxBo, and
one of his first contributions was vbprep (and an accompanying GUI,
vbprepform).  It's easier to use, and should help you automate
complicated analysis sequences.

<h3>Recent VoxBo Appearances</h3>

<p>
I presented a brief VoxBo talk at the The Human Brain Project Spring
meeting last year, which is archived <a
href="http://videocast.nih.gov/ram/brain051203.ram">here</a>.  There's
other interesting stuff in the stream of course, but if you want to
find my talk, it's towards the end of the day (unfortunately, the
whole day's talks are in one long stream).
</p>

<h3>VoxBo Installation Service</h3>

<p>
We've occasionally installed VoxBo for other labs, either at Penn or
elsewhere.  Since 
I've been thinking about formalizing this slightly, just
by advertising that we're willing to help get it installed for anyone
who needs help (and is willing to loan us their root password).  This
would be a good incentive for us to make the software easier to
install, and might make other folks more comfortable trying it out.
</p>

<h3>Completely Free VoxBo Update</h3>

<p>
Yes, VoxBo still depends on IDL.  We didn't even come close to getting
rid of IDL by the end of last year, and this year looks improbable.
But we have made a tremendous amount of progress.  Here's an updated
list of the big pieces that need replacement.  Note that the list has
shrunk dramatically, and is actually fairly short.
</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
The voxel surfer.  This is still the largest piece that hasn't been
addressed.  A lot of the functionality can be mimicked once we have a
more modular system for generating statistical maps, but some pieces
will take some more concerted effort.

<li>
The G matrix designer.  Some functionality still hasn't been ported
over from the IDL version, including some of the covariate
transformations and the evaluation functions.  Dongbo is working on
these things (and more).

<li>
Smaller tools.  I believe the three tools we're most desperate to have
outside of IDL are close to reality.  Dongbo has been working on a
vector browser that will handle regular vectors (e.g., ref files) as
well as movement parameters, replacing graphmoveparams.  He's also
working on new code to handle the 1/f parameter estimation and
graphing.  We should soon have a stand-alone smoothing tool, one way
or another.

</ul>
