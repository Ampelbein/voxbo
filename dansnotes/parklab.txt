notes on park lab install

logged on, couldn't find a suitable network-mounted volume for voxbo
system directory, so i decided to create one on denisep02.  i added
/usr/local/VoxBo to denisep02's export list, and denisep01's fstab,
but it wouldn't mount.  so for now, voxbo is just available on
denisep02.  i'll add some notes the the bottom of this file on getting
it working on the other machine.

added user voxbo on denisep02

created directory /usr/local/VoxBo on denisep02, set owner to voxbo

su'ed to voxbo user

downloaded and unpacked the VoxBo distribution

made bin directory and symbolic link bin-Linux

went into src and did a make install to install binaries.  something
went wrong, so i had to scp the binaries from our local machines.

scp'ed required gsl libraries from our lab machines

added vbsrvd to /etc/services

copied /usr/local/VoxBo/misc/xinetd-vbsrvd to /etc/xinetd.d/vbsrvd

added three lines to /etc/hosts.allow, to allow connections from local
host, denisep01 and 02

restarted xinetd

corrected some minor issues with the idl code



Things that still need to be done
---------------------------------

Everyone who wants to run VoxBo should have /usr/local/VoxBo/bin in
their PATH, and should probably have their IDL_PATH set thusly:

IDL_PATH=+/usr/local/rsi/idl/lib:/usr/local/VoxBo/pros:+/usr/local/rsi/idl/examples


To install denisep01:

- make sure denisep01 and denisep02 can see the same VoxBo directory,
  via some combination of NFS mounts and symbolic links.  best if it's
  at /usr/local/VoxBo on both machines
- copy /usr/local/VoxBo/libs/* from 02 to /usr/lib on 01
- add vbsrvd line to /etc/services on 01 (copy from 02)
- copy xinetd config file to 01
- restart xinetd (/etc/init.d/xinetd restart)
- go to /usr/local/VoxBo/etc/servers, copy the denisep02 file to
  denisep01, and make the obvious changes
- modify /etc/hosts.allow similarly to 02
- try voxq -c on both machines to make sure each can see the other
