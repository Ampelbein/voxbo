# If you're not running VoxBo in cluster mode, you can ignore this
# file.

# Here is a quick tutorial on how to set up servers.  Skim it, then
# use the example file to get started.

# Each server gets its own file.  Files named "README" or containing
# the characters ~, #, $, or % are ignored.  Each server file has a
# bunch of fields, some optional, which describe what that machine can
# or can't do.

# speed - currently unused, but we set it anyway, so that we can tweak
# prioritizing.

# avail - specifies when the machine is available for batch jobs.
# Each line takes a range of days, a range of hours, a priority, and a
# number of cpus for that time period.  Note that priority 3 means
# only jobs of pri 3 or greater can run at that time.  So if you want
# stuff to run more, set the priority lower.

# provides - lists what services the server provides.  These services
# correspond to the "requires" lines in your jobtypes files.  You can
# no longer use "all" -- you must name every service.

# Limited resources (like software licenses) are slightly more
# complicated.  Here's the way the food chain works.  In the jobtype
# file, a particular jobtype might have a line like "requires idl 6".
# That means it always requires 6 IDL licenses.  Or it might have a
# line like "requires idl", which would mean it requires IDL, without
# saying how many licenses.

# There are three forms for the provides line in the server config:

# provides idl -- provides idl no matter what resources are required

# provides idl license-idl -- provides idl as long as some host has a
# resource called "license-idl" in enough quantity to satisfy the job

# provides idl license-idl 6 -- same as the above, but requires 6
# licenses no matter what the jobtype says.

# If you have one central license server, then all your servers'
# "provides" lines should have a resource listed (not just "provides
# idl" but "provides idl license-idl" or "provides idl license-idl
# 6"), but only the license server gets a "resource" line.  If each
# machine runs its own license server, then you need a resource for
# each machine (use different names for each, something like
# idl-hostname).  If you have unlimited licenses, then you don't need
# any resource lines.

# We use this mechanism mainly for licenses.  You could in principle
# use it for any limited resource, either to make sure jobs only run
# on machines with available cpu power, or with no active users logged
# in.
