# Sample text file used to initialize permission table
# Each line includes three fields separated by space: access_ID, data_ID, permission
#
# If access_ID is the wild character of '*', then all users/groups are loowed to access
# certain data with specified permission on lthat line.
# If data_ID is '*', then user/group on that line is allowed to access any data 
# with specified permission on that line.
#
# So far only three permissions are allowed: b (browse), r (read), rw (read and write)
#
# Note that access_ID can be either user ID or group ID. But here we assume the first field 
# is ALWAYS user ID. In a real txt file, this permission to too bold to be true. So initPerm.cpp
# has to be modofied to include both user and group ID.

# Allows admin, dhu and kimberg to access any data with rw permission 
admin * rw
dhu * rw
kimberg * rw
